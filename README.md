# FFDataViewer
A WinForms data viewer based on my favorite game series of all time.

Underneath, we are reading XML data and throwing it into a Winforms application. 

The XML data is based upon my favorite video game series: Final Fantasy, developed by Square Enix, formerlly Square. Lasting from the 1980's, Final Fantasy was Square's last ditch effort before going bankrupt. Now, the series of Final Fantasy has many spin-offs, sequels, and fifteen main entries in the franchise.

If you need help running this application, email me.
